The jumping ball
It is a program which user can interact with by their phone.

Summary
This is a simple interactive game which users can interact by scanning the QR code on their phone. 
There are three balls in the program. The users move the blue ball by rotating their phone. 
Use the blue ball to catch up with the red ball which in the random position.
In the process, when the blue ball bump into the white ball which in the regular route moves, the game is over.

Component Parts
The moving blue ball is using the "rotation" program.
If the user bump into the white ball, "Game Over" will show on the screen.
If the blue ball hits the red ball, the blue ball will become random color and become larger by a certain value.
"Random"
"If"
"rotation"

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use. You can also upload an image with a diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:
Timeline
What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

Week 0: Write Proposal
Week 1: Make the blue ball moves by "rotation"
Week 2: Add the red "random ball", and the "white obstacle ball"
Week 3: Add score at the top of the screen
Week 4: Present!

Challenges
At first, I want to make the white ball move randomly on the page, but I found it will be hard for the user to play if the blue ball becomes too large.
So I changed the white ball's move routine into regular route.
I found it hard to understand the "rotation" program at first, but after I looked at the program I did before, I overcome the difficulties.

Completed Work
Upload photos and videos of your completed final project!

Also upload the code that makes up your project to your repository.
